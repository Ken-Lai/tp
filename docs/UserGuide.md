# FumbleLog Tutorial
This tutorial is designed for new users looking to get started using FumbleLog. In this tutorial, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to use commands in FumbleLog to help you manage
your contacts and events.

1. First launch FumbleLog. You may refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide if you have forgotten how to.
2. Lets first try **adding a person**, `Mary Lee`, to your contact list. Enter the command: `add_person n/Mary Lee p/91234567 e/mary@gmail.com a/Mary Street #01-01 b/2001-12-12 g/Family`. You should see FumbleLog successfully adding the contact to the contact list:
![Tutorial Add](images/tutorialAdd.png)
3. Now, lets try **editing the name and email** of your contact. Let's use the index of `Mary Lee` shown in the list (in this case 1), and edit her information: `edit_person 1 n/John Doe e/John@gmail.com`. FumbleLog should reflect the changes to your contact immediately:
![Tutorial Edit](images/tutorialEdit.png)
4. Try adding a few more contacts and assign them to the same `Family` group using the `g/` parameter. Your contact list should look something like this:
![Tutorial Add More](images/tutorialAddMore.png)
5. Now, lets say `John`'s birthday is in a few weeks. We can **add this event** to FumbleLog using this command: `add_event m/John birthday d/2023-12-12`.
![Tutorial Event Add](images/tutorialEventAdd.png)
6. If everyone in the `Family` group is attending `John`'s birthday, you can easily assign every contact in the group to the event. In this case, simply **edit the event** by assigning the `Family` group, as such: `edit_event 1 g/Family`. Now you should see everyone in the `Family` group is assigned to `John`'s birthday.
![Tutorial Event Edit](images/tutorialEventEdit.png)
7. Finally, once the event is over, you can **delete the event** by using the index of the event (in this case 1): `delete_event 1`.
8. **Well done! üëç** You have mastered the basics of FumbleLog! You can now visit the [Features](#features) section to learn advanced commands!


# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied with the command.<br>
  e.g. in `add_person n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_person n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/family` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times (or not at all).<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [g/GROUP]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `n/John Doe` (i.e. 0 times), `n/John Doe g/friend`, `n/John Doe g/friend g/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Invalid prefixes, such as `t/` will be regarded as a part of the input, for example `n/John Doe t/friend`, the name 
  will be parsed as `John Doe t/friend` instead of `John Doe`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list_all`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

> **Below are some examples on how to use the `edit_person` command:**
> 
> *  `edit_person 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`: Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
> *  `edit_person 2 n/Betsy Crower g/CS2103T`: Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and assigns this person to the group `CS2103T`. Any events that Betsy Crower is assigned to is also updated with this new name.
> *  `edit_person 3 n/Betsy Crower b/2023-09-29`: Edits the name of the 3rd person to be `Betsy Crower` and changes the birthday to 29th Sep 2023. Any events that Betsy Crower is assigned to is also updated with this new name.

**Notes on the `edit_person`command:**
* At least one of the parameters must be provided.
* For all values, except for `GROUP`, existing values will be updated to the input values.
  * Parameters `p/`, `e/`, `a/` and `b/` can be empty strings. Doing so will clear the current values for the respective fields. i.e. `edit_person 1 a/` will remove the current `ADDRESS`.
  * Parameter `g/` is used to assign a person to a group. If the person is already assigned to the group, the group will not be added again.
  * Parameter `ug/` is used to unassign a person from a group. Once unassigned, the person's name will not be displayed in events that the group is assigned to.
* When you edit a person's name, the person's name will be updated in all [events](#commands-for-events) that the person is assigned to. Same for groups if the person's group is assigned to events.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-warning-circle"></i> **Note when editing a person in a filtered contacts list:**<br>

  * You used the command `find_person Alex`, to show all the persons with `Alex` in their name.  See: [find_person](#locating-persons-by-name-or-group-findperson)
  * The person list is filtered to show all the persons with `Alex` in their name.
  * You then edit `Alex` name to be something else, i.e., `Bob`.
  * `Alex` will disappear form the person list. **Do not worry, your data is not deleted**, this is because your previous search term `Alex` no longer matches the new name of the person, `Bob`.
  * To see `Bob` in the person list again, you can use the [list_persons](#listing-all-persons--listpersons) command to bring back the whole list of persons.
  * In contrast with the above scenario, using an [add_person](#adding-a-person-addperson) command will automatically bring back the whole list of persons, to show you that your new person has been added to FumbleLog.
</div>

**Expected output when the command succeeds:**
* Input: `edit_person 1 n/Alexa Yeoh` changes the name of the 1st person to be `Alexa Yeoh`, leaving the rest of the fields unchanged.

### Deleting a person : `delete_person`

FumbleLog allows you to organize your contact list by deleting contacts that are no longer relevant.

Format: `delete_person PERSON_INDEX`

**Acceptable values for each parameter:**

| Parameter      | Format                                             | Example |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `PERSON_INDEX` | An index in the currently displayed contacts list. | `1`     |


> **Below are some examples on how to use `delete_person` command:**
> 
> * `list_all` followed by `delete_person 2`: Deletes the 2nd person in the person list.
> * `find_all Betsy` followed by `delete_person 1`: Deletes the 1st person in the filtered list as a result of the `find` command. i.e Any person named `Betsy` at index `1` will be deleted.

**Notes on `delete_person` command:**
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* When a person is deleted, any [events](#commands-for-events) that the person is assigned to will also be updated, i.e. the person will be unassigned from the event.

**This should be the expected output when the command succeeds:**

Input: `delete_person 1` deletes the first person on the list.

![DeletePerson](images/DeletePerson.png)

### Locating persons by name or group: `find_person`

If you would like to quickly search for a contact, FumbleLog allows you to search for contacts by name or group.

Format: `find_person KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**Acceptable values for each parameter:**

| Parameter                    | Format                                                                     | Example              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `KEYWORD`  or `MORE_KEYWORDS` | Use any characters including whitespace. Must not only contain whitespaces | `Alice` or `friends` |

>
> * `find_person John`: Displays `john` and `John Doe`
> * `find_person friends`: Displays `Alex Yeoh` as he belongs to the `friends` group.

**Notes on `find_person` command:**
* Only **full words** will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* The search is **case-insensitive**. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `find_person Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-warning-circle"></i> **Note when finding a person:**<br>

* FumbleLog will return an empty person list when there are no keyword matches. **Your data is not deleted.**
</div>

**Expected output when the command succeeds:**

Input: `find_person Alexa` displays all contacts with the name `Alexa` in the contact list.

## Commands for Events

### Properties of events
Before you proceed to use commands to manage events, you should know the properties of an event in FumbleLog.

| Parameter                   | Format                                                                                    | Example           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `EVENT_NAME`                | Use `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and whitespaces only.                                             | `CS2103T meeting` |
| `DATE`                      | Have format `yyyy-MM-dd` and should not be earlier than current date.                     | `2023-12-01`      |
| `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` | Have format `HHmm`. `START_TIME` should be earlier than `END_TIME`.                       | `1400`            |
| `NAME`                      | Multiple persons can be assigned to an event but only existing persons name can be added. | `John Doe`        |
| `GROUP`                     | Multiple groups can be assigned to an event but only existing groups can be added.        | `CS2103T`         |

### Adding an event : `add_event`

Add an event to the events list in FumbleLog.

Format: `add_event m/EVENT_NAME d/DATE [s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME] [n/PERSON_NAME]... [g/GROUP]...`

- `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` are optional.
- `PERSON_NAME` is optional and multiple persons can be added at once, however only persons that exist can be added.
- `GROUP` is optional, however only groups that exist can be added.
- The given `DATE`, `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` cannot be a time in the past.
- The given `START_TIME` must be before the given `END_TIME`.
- If the meeting is added successfully, it will automatically be sorted by date and time with the earliest meeting at the top of the list.
- All dates are to be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`. i.e. 2023-10-05 for 5th Oct 2023.
- All time are to be in the format `HHmm`. i.e. 1400 for 2pm.
- If the given `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` are not given, the default values are `0000` and `2359` respectively.
- Note that if a person appears under multiple groups, e.g `Alvin` is in groups `classmates` and `friends`, the name `Alvin` will appear under both groups when displayed in the events list. This is an intended behavior for you to see everyone in the groups that are assigned to the event. This is illustrated as follows.

### Editing an event : `edit_event`

Edits an existing event in FumbleLog.

Format: `edit_event EVENT_INDEX [m/MEETING_DETAILS] [d/DATE] [s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME] [n/PERSON_NAME]... [u/PERSON_NAME]... [g/GROUP]... [ug/GROUP]...`

* **At least one of the optional parameters required.**
* The input values will replace the existing values, except for `PERSON` AND `GROUP`.
* `PERSON` and `GROUP` edits are cumulative and will add to the current list of persons and groups.
  Use the unassign commands, i.e. `u/PERSON` or `ug/GROUP`, if you would like to unassign any person or group.
* All dates are to be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`. i.e. 2023-10-05 for 5th Oct 2023
* All time are to be in the format `HHmm`. i.e. 1400 for 2pm.
* The given `DATE`, `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` cannot be a time in the past.
* Note that if a person appears under multiple groups, e.g `Alvin` is in groups `classmates` and `friends`, the name `Alvin` will appear under both groups when displayed in the events list. This is an intended behavior for you to see everyone in the groups that are assigned to the event. This is illustrated as follows.
* Note the following scenario:
  * You have an event stored in FumbleLog, e.g an event named `TP meeting` and you used `find_event meeting` as a command. See: [find_event](#locating-events-by-name-group-or-person-findevent)
  * The event list is filtered to show all the persons with `meeting` in their name.
  * You edit `TP meeting` event name to be something else, e.g, `TP sprint`.
  * `TP meeting` disappears form the person list. Do not worry, your data is not deleted, this is because your previous search term `meeting` no longer matches the new name of the event, `TP sprint`.
  * To see `TP sprint` in the event list again, you can use the [list_events](#listing-all-events-listevents) command to bring back the whole list of events.
  * In contrast with the above scenario, using an [add_event](#adding-an-event--addevent) command will automatically bring back the whole list of events, to show you that your new event has been added to FumbleLog.

* ![Person appearing multiple times](images/DuplicatePersonInDifferentGroups.png)

Examples:
* `edit_event 1 m/FumbleLog meeting d/2023-10-05 s/1500 e/1700`
* `edit_event 1 g/CS2103T g/CS2101`: Adds the groups CS2103T and CS2101 to the event.
* `edit_event 1 u/Ken`: Unassigns the person `Ken` from the event.

Acceptable values for each parameter:
* `EVENT_INDEX`: The index position of the event in the displayed event list.
* `[m/EVENT_DETAILS]`: Details of the event to be changed.
* `[d/DATE]`: A valid date in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`
* `[s/START_TIME]`: A valid time in the format `HHmm`
* `[e/END_TIME]`: A valid time in the format `HHmm`
* `[n/PERSON_NAME]`: Name of the person to be assigned.
* `[u/PERSON_NAME]`: Name of the person to be unassigned.
* `[g/GROUP]`: Name of the group to be assigned.
* `[ug/GROUP]`: Name of the group to be unassigned.

Expected output when the command succeeds: 

Input: `edit_event 1 m/tP week 3 meeting d/2023-10-05 s/1500 e/1700`
